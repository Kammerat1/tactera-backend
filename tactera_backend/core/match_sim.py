# -------------------------------------------------------------
# Basic Match Simulator (MVP)
# -------------------------------------------------------------
# This function simulates a single match by:
# 1. Generating random goals for home and away teams.
# 2. Marking the match as played and saving results in the DB.
# Future expansion: weighted team strength, event logs, stats.
